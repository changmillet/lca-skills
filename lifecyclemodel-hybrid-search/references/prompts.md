# Prompt requirements

- Accept input in any language or mixed languages; interpret it correctly.
- Preserve lifecycle model constraints: functional unit, system boundary, LCIA methodology, life-cycle stages, geography, time/reference year, technology route, allocation method, datasets referenced, and scenario assumptions; do not drop constraints.
- Keep any structured filters (JSON or key/value hints) intact; do not rewrite keys, values, or nesting.
- Do not invent facts or infer conditions not provided.
- Keep output retrieval-oriented: concise noun-heavy query with core qualifiers; add common synonyms/abbreviations when helpful.
- Keep language neutral and concise; no explanations or reasoning.
